# UniversityManagementSystem
📝👩‍🎓 Welcome to our Univesity management system! 🎓📊

Our system uses two text files, course.txt and student.txt, to store information about courses and students, respectively.

Here are the main functions of our system:

1️⃣ all_courses_1(): displays a list of all available courses, including their code, name, teacher, and the number of enrolled students.

3️⃣ add_new_course_3(): allows the user to add a new course to the system by entering its code, name, and teacher.

4️⃣ searchbycode_4(): lets the user search for a course by its code.

5️⃣ search_course_by_name_5(): enables the user to search for a course by its name.

6️⃣ register_student_6(): allows the user to register a student to a course by entering the student's ID and the course code.

7️⃣ top3_crowded_courses_7(): displays the three most popular courses with the highest number of enrolled students.

8️⃣ top3_registration_student_8(): displays the three students with the most course registrations.

Our system aims to make managing courses and student registrations easy and efficient. Thank you for choosing our course management system! 💻🤝
